# Learning C# Projects
 Some projects I have been doing to learn c#

 I have 2 C# programs:

 1. Basic Conversation

 BasicConversation contains a simple conversation which will run and allow the user to input a name and basically conatins the absolute basic of C#.

 2. Variables
 
 A program dedicated to variables and is basically a calculator which cycles through multiplication of 2 numbers, finding the average of 3 numbers and finding a certain percaentage of a certain number, all chosen by the user. However the first calculation can be easily tweaked to perform any one of the 4 basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
 
3. Conditions
A program which displays a question. The program then takes input from the user and using "if statements" displays if the input answer was correct or incorrect. it does this 3 times which means 3 questions, which can be easily changed.

4. Loops
A program which allows the user to press "enter". This then rolls two dices and displays the numbers. This is repeated until the two numbers rolled are the same before the program then displays that you have rolled a two-of-a-kind and even shows the number of attempts.

5. Arrays
A program which allows the user to input the number of students and then input their names. The program then sorts the names into alphabetical order. However, the program can be easily changed to ask for the number of things and their names, e.g staff on duty, before again sorting the names into alphabetical order.


I hope you enjoy my experiements!
