# Learning C# Projects
 Some projects I have been doing to learn c#

 I have 2 C# programs:

 1. Basic Conversation

 BasicConversation contains a simple conversation which will run and allow the user to input a name and basically conatins the absolute basic of C#.

 2. Calculator
 
 A program dedicated to variables and is basically a calculator which cycles through multiplication of 2 numbers, finding the average of 3 numbers and finding a certain percaentage of a certain number, all chosen by the user. However the first calculation can be easily tweaked to perform any one of the 4 basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
 
3. Maths Game
A program which displays a question. The program then takes input from the user and using "if statements" displays if the input answer was correct or incorrect. it does this 3 times which means 3 questions, which can be easily changed.


I hope you enjoy my experiements!
