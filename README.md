# Learning C# Projects
 Some projects I have been doing to learn c#

 I have 2 C# programs:

 1. BasicConversation
 2. calculator

 The first one contains a simple conversation which will run and allow the user to input a name and basically conatins the absolute basic of C#.
 
 The second one in a program dedicated to variables and is basically a calculator which cycles through multiplication of 2 numbers, finding the average of 3 numbers and finding a certain percaentage of a certain number, all chosen by the user. However the first calculation can be easily tweaked to perform any one of the 4 basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Enjoy!!!!!
